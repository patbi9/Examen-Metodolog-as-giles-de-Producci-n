Where’s My Phone?
Mitski

[Chorus]
Where did it go?
Where's my phone?
Where's my phone?
Where did I leave?
Where'd I go?
Where'd I go?

[Verse 1]
A woman always on the street called me a ditch
"A ditch on my block," she said
I just want my mind to be a clear glass
Clear glass with nothing in my head
I keep thinking, "Surely, somebody will save me"
At every turn, I learn that no one will
I just want my mind to be a clear glass
Clear glass with nothing instead (Pa-pa-pa)

[Chorus]
Oh, where did I leave?
Where'd I go?
Where'd I go?
Where did it go?
Where's my phone?
Where's my phone?

[Verse 2]
If night is like you punched a hole into tomorrow
I would **** the hole all night long
I'll stay out until my mind is like a clear glass
Clear glass with nothing going on
Or like a bug floating in the melted amber
Of a citronella candle
I will float until my mind is like a clear wax
Clear wax, melted in the dome (Pa-pa-pa)
Clear wax, melted in the dome (Pa-pa-pa)

[Bridge]
La-da-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa

[Outro]
(Where did it go?)
(Where's my phone?)
(Where's my phone?)
(Where did it go?)
(Where's my phone?)
(Where's my phone?)
